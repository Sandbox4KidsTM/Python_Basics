Gaussian Addition
This challenge is inspired by a story about the mathematician Carl Frederich Gauss. As the story goes, when young Gauss was in grade school his teacher got mad at his class one day.

"I'll keep the lot of you busy for a while", the teacher said sternly to the group. "You are to add the numbers from 1 to 100, and you are not to say a word until you are done."

The teacher expected a good period of quiet time, but a moment later our mathematician-to-be raised his hand with the answer. "It's 5050!" Gauss had realized that if you list all the numbers from 1 to 100, you can always match the first and last numbers in the list and get a common answer:

1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100
1 + 100 = 101
2 + 99 = 101
3 + 98 = 101

Gauss realized there were exactly 50 pairs of numbers in the range 1 to 100, so he did a quick calculation: 50 * 101 = 5050.

Write a program that passes a list of numbers to a function.
The function should use a while loop to keep popping the first and last numbers from the list and calculate the sum of those two numbers.
The function should print out the current numbers that are being added, and print their partial sum.
The function should keep track of how many partial sums there are.
The function should then print out how many partial sums there were.
The function should perform Gauss' multiplication, and report the final answer.
Prove that your function works, by passing in the range 1-100, and verifying that you get 5050.
gauss_addition(list(range(1,101)))
Your function should work for any set of consecutive numbers, as long as that set has an even length.
Bonus: Modify your function so that it works for any set of consecutive numbers, whether that set has an even or odd length.
